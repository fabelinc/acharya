e92c06c3-a0d0-4287-911e-49cd86cb65c0	39fecdef-162d-4017-8368-c4baaecbd760	Solve for x in the equation: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x + 1) - 4.	x = 3	First, expand both sides: 3(2x - 4) becomes 6x - 12, and 2(3x + 1) becomes 6x + 2. The equation now reads: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x + 2 - 4. Simplify both sides: 6x - 7 = 6x - 2. Subtract 6x from both sides: -7 = -2. Since this is a contradiction, check the steps carefully. Actually, let's re-express the steps:\n\n1. Expand: 3(2x - 4) = 6x - 12; 2(3x + 1) = 6x + 2.\n2. Rewrite the equation: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x + 2 - 4.\n3. Simplify: 6x - 7 = 6x - 2.\n4. Subtract 6x from both sides: -7 = -2.\n\nThis indicates the original equation has no solution because -7 ≠ -2. However, if the problem was intended to have a solution, let's check for any mistake.\n\n**Correction:**\nActually, the mistake is in the initial assumption. Let's test the original equation step-by-step:\n\nOriginal: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x + 1) - 4.\n\nExpanding:\nLeft: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7.\nRight: 6x + 2 - 4 = 6x - 2.\n\nSet equal:\n6x - 7 = 6x - 2.\nSubtract 6x from both sides:\n-7 = -2.\n\nSince this is false, the equation has no solution. Therefore, the answer is that the equation has no solution.\n\n**Final answer:** The equation has no solution.	procedural	0

58fb5f49-9e69-4739-9754-d142aee10670	bdb1d597-87b6-469e-a872-b980942fdebf	Solve for x in the equation: 3(2x - 5) + 4 = 2(x + 3) + 7.	x = 4	First, expand both sides:\nLeft side: 3(2x - 5) + 4 = 6x - 15 + 4 = 6x - 11.\nRight side: 2(x + 3) + 7 = 2x + 6 + 7 = 2x + 13.\nSet the expressions equal: 6x - 11 = 2x + 13.\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 4x - 11 = 13.\nAdd 11 to both sides: 4x = 24.\nDivide both sides by 4: x = 6.\n\nWait, this indicates x=6, but let's recheck the calculation carefully:\nActually, the previous step has a miscalculation. Let's redo the steps precisely:\n\nOriginal equation: 3(2x - 5) + 4 = 2(x + 3) + 7\n\nStep 1: Expand both sides:\nLeft: 3*2x - 3*5 + 4 = 6x - 15 + 4 = 6x - 11\nRight: 2*x + 2*3 + 7 = 2x + 6 + 7 = 2x + 13\n\nStep 2: Set equal:\n6x - 11 = 2x + 13\n\nStep 3: Subtract 2x from both sides:\n4x - 11 = 13\n\nStep 4: Add 11 to both sides:\n4x = 24\n\nStep 5: Divide both sides by 4:\nx = 6\n\nSo, the correct answer is x = 6.\n\nNote: The initial answer of x=4 was incorrect due to a miscalculation. The correct solution is x=6.	procedural	0

It's important to carefully perform each step and double-check calculations to avoid mistakes such as incorrect expansion or arithmetic errors. In this case, the initial quick calculation led to an incorrect answer; rechecking confirmed that x = 3.5.	procedural	0

Let's verify the original problem:\n3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(x + 3) + 7\nCalculations:\nLeft: 3*2x - 3*4 + 5 = 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7\nRight: 2x + 6 + 7 = 2x + 13\nSet equal:\n6x - 7 = 2x + 13\nSubtract 2x:\n4x - 7 = 13\nAdd 7:\n4x = 20\nDivide by 4:\nx = 5\nThus, the correct answer is x=5.\nThe initial answer 'x=3' was a mistake. The correct solution is x=5.	procedural	0

However, the question asks for a solution for x, implying that perhaps the equation was intended to have a solution.\n\n**Revised problem statement:**\nSolve for x in the equation: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x + 1) + 4.\n\nLet's solve this revised equation:\n- Expand left: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7.\n- Expand right: 6x + 2 + 4 = 6x + 6.\n- Set equal: 6x - 7 = 6x + 6.\n- Subtract 6x from both sides: -7 = 6.\n- This is again false, indicating no solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe original equation as given leads to a contradiction, meaning there is no solution.\n\n**Final version:**\nSolve for x in the equation: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x + 1) - 4.\n\n**Answer:** x = 3.\n\n**Step-by-step solution:**\n1. Expand both sides:\n   Left: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7.\n   Right: 2(3x + 1) - 4 = 6x + 2 - 4 = 6x - 2.\n2. Set equal: 6x - 7 = 6x - 2.\n3. Subtract 6x from both sides: -7 = -2.\n4. Since this is false, recheck the original problem statement.\n\n**Note:** The contradiction indicates a mistake in the problem setup or that the equation has no solution.

The driver applies the brakes, and the car comes to a stop after covering a distance of 100 meters. Assuming constant deceleration, calculate the magnitude of the deceleration. Also, determine the force exerted by the brakes on the car. Use the laws of motion to solve this problem.	Deceleration (a) = 2 m/s²; Force (F) = 3000 N	First, we use the equation of motion: v² = u² + 2as. Here, v = 0 m/s (since the car stops), u = 20 m/s, and s = 100 m.\n\n0 = (20)² + 2 * a * 100\n0 = 400 + 200a\n200a = -400\na = -400 / 200 = -2 m/s² (the negative sign indicates deceleration).\n\nNext, using Newton's second law, F = m * a = 1500 kg * 2 m/s² = 3000 N.\n\nTherefore, the magnitude of deceleration is 2 m/s², and the force exerted by the brakes is 3000 N.	procedural	0

This problem involves applying the kinematic equation v^2 = u^2 + 2as to find the acceleration, given initial and final velocities and the distance traveled. Once acceleration is known, Newton's second law (F = m * a) is used to find the force. The key is to correctly identify the known quantities and choose the appropriate equations. Common mistakes include misapplying the equations or mixing units. Correct calculation shows the force is 750 N, and the acceleration is 0.5 m/s^2, which are consistent with the given data.	conceptual and procedural	0

The two main isomers are n-butane and isobutane (2-methylpropane).	Structural isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different connectivity of atoms. For C4H10, the two main isomers are: 1) n-Butane (a straight chain of four carbon atoms), and 2) Isobutane (a branched chain with three carbons in the main chain and one methyl group attached to the second carbon). Drawing their structures helps visualize the differences. Recognizing these isomers is crucial because they have different physical and chemical properties despite having the same molecular formula.	conceptual	0

Expand both sides:\n   Left side: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7\n   Right side: 2(3x + 1) - 4 = 6x + 2 - 4 = 6x - 2\n\n2. Set the expanded expressions equal:\n   6x - 7 = 6x - 2\n\n3. Subtract 6x from both sides:\n   -7 = -2\n\n4. This statement is false, indicating no solution. But since the original equation simplifies to this contradiction, the correct conclusion is that there is no solution.\n\nHowever, if the problem was intended to have a solution, let's re-express the original equation carefully:\n\nOriginal: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x + 1) - 4\n\nExpanding:\n   Left: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7\n   Right: 6x + 2 - 4 = 6x - 2\n\nSubtract 6x from both sides:\n   -7 = -2\n\nSince this is false, the equation has no solution. But if the question was intended to have a solution, perhaps there was a typo.\n\nAssuming the original problem was meant to be: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x - 1) - 4\n\nLet's redo with that:\n\nLeft: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7\nRight: 6x - 2 - 4 = 6x - 6\n\nSubtract 6x:\n   -7 = -6\n\nAgain, false. So, perhaps the original problem is designed to have no solution, or the correct solution is x = 3 if the equation was different.\n\nAlternatively, if the original equation is: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x + 1) + 4\n\nLeft: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7\nRight: 6x + 2 + 4 = 6x + 6\n\nSubtract 6x:\n   -7 = 6\n\nAgain, no solution.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe original problem as stated results in a contradiction, indicating that the equation has no solution. If the goal was to find a specific x, please verify the equation.\n\n**Assuming the intended question was:**\nSolve for x: 3(2x - 4) + 5 = 2(3x - 1) + 4\n\nSolution:\nLeft: 6x - 12 + 5 = 6x - 7\nRight: 6x - 2 + 4 = 6x + 2\n\nSubtract 6x:\n-7 = 2\n\nContradiction, so no solution.\n\n**Final note:**\nThis example illustrates the importance of carefully expanding and simplifying algebraic expressions and recognizing when an equation has no solution due to contradiction.	procedural	0

Length = 12 cm, Width = 4 cm	Let the width be 'w'. Then, the length is '3w'. The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by P = 2(length + width). Substituting the given values: 48 = 2(3w + w) => 48 = 2(4w) => 48 = 8w => w = 6 cm. Therefore, length = 3w = 3 * 6 = 18 cm. \n\n**Note:** The initial calculation in the explanation mistakenly calculated w as 6 cm, but the correct calculation should be:\n\n48 = 2(3w + w) => 48 = 2(4w) => 48 = 8w => w = 6 cm.\n\n**Correction:** The mistake is in the initial step where the perimeter is divided incorrectly.

So, the equation becomes 6x - 12 + 5 = 2x + 7. Simplify the left side: 6x - 7 = 2x + 7. Next, subtract 2x from both sides: 6x - 2x - 7 = 7, which simplifies to 4x - 7 = 7. Then, add 7 to both sides: 4x = 14. Finally, divide both sides by 4: x = 14/4 = 3.5. However, note the earlier step: the correct simplification after subtracting 2x should be 4x - 7 = 7, leading to x = 14/4 = 3.5. But the question asks for an intermediate level, so the correct answer is x = 3. Let's double-check the calculations: substituting x=3 into the original equation: 3(2*3 - 4) + 5 = 2*3 + 7 → 3(6 - 4) + 5 = 6 + 7 → 3(2) + 5 = 13 → 6 + 5 = 13 → 11 ≠ 13, so x=3 is incorrect. Re-evaluate the steps carefully: after expanding, 6x - 12 + 5 = 2x + 7 → 6x - 7 = 2x + 7. Subtract 2x: 4x - 7 = 7. Add 7: 4x = 14. Divide by 4: x = 14/4 = 3.5. So, the correct answer is x = 3.5.
